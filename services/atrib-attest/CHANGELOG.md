# @atrib/attest

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 5da8f9b: Strengthen the signed-action reference path. The wrapper now defaults to
  tool, argument, and result commitments with linked request and outcome
  records. Runtime coverage manifests bind expected capture surfaces to bounded
  run evidence. Action Gate adds a one-time protected MCP executor. Verification
  adds pinned witness checks, checkpoint gossip incidents, trusted-time
  delegation evaluation, and explicit missing-scope evidence. The CLI adds a
  named principal, workspace, agent, and ephemeral-run identity flow with
  accepted prior-run retirement. Protected execution and verification consume
  verified, reloadable revocation views.
  Recall and the TypeScript SDK add a policy-bound current-state projection
  over verified revision lineages. The projection exposes every active head,
  keeps forks unresolved, bounds fork and exclusion fan-out with truncation
  metadata, and reports its signer, context, and inclusion basis. The open
  explorer session view renders public revision commitments, conflicts, and
  partial roots without claiming that browser projection applied receiver
  policy.
  The specification now contains one normative session-checkpoint section
  instead of two byte-identical copies.
  Log subscriptions now resume after an exact log-index cursor, honor native
  `EventSource` reconnect headers, and reject cursor rollback instead of losing
  or duplicating the disconnected interval. The open explorer uses that stream
  for live activity and keeps polling as a compatibility fallback.
  The explorer action view now distinguishes the log's compact commitment entry
  from the signed record body. It reports whether the configured archive returned
  the body, never labels a commitment projection as a raw record, and serves
  direct action, session, identity, and trace routes from the fallback log host.
  The TypeScript client adds an explicit application action helper that signs a
  salted request before execution and a linked salted terminal outcome. Direct
  attest calls now carry argument and result salts through the same record path
  as middleware. Verification classifies committed, inconsistent,
  uncorroborated, and corroborated result evidence without claiming that hashes
  prove real-world truth.

### Minor Changes

- b40f207: The attest/recall rename ([D164](DECISIONS.md#d164-attestrecall-verb-rename-and-primitive-surface-collapse)). `@atrib/attest` is the new write-verb home: one `attest` tool signs observations, annotations (`ref.kind: "annotates"`), and revisions (`ref.kind: "revises"`), with the legacy `emit` / `atrib-annotate` / `atrib-revise` tool names mounted as permanent aliases over the same handler; records are byte-identical in canonical form. `@atrib/recall` absorbs the trace and handoff-verification implementations and adds the `recall` read verb (shape dispatch, walk directions, and a `verification` parameter with a typed `verifier_unavailable` degradation; `@atrib/verify` becomes an optional peer). `@atrib/emit`, `@atrib/annotate`, `@atrib/revise`, `@atrib/trace`, and `@atrib/verify-mcp` become re-export shims over the new homes; every legacy binary forwards and every legacy import keeps working. The primitives runtime mounts the seventeen-tool alias-window union. Zero signed bytes change; existing mirrors and records stay valid.
