> **Pre-0.2.0 versions exist in this changelog but were never published to npm.**
> The package was renamed from `@atrib/atrib-trace` to `@atrib/trace` and flipped public on 2026-05-05; prior bumps were workspace-private. The first npm-published version is 0.2.0.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c35127f: Publish the 4 cognitive-primitive MCP servers to npm.

  These were previously workspace-private (developers ran them from source). They now ship as installable npm packages so any agent runtime can pull them in directly.

  `@atrib/emit`, producer-side: agents sign explicit observations, annotations, and revisions beyond what middleware auto-signs.

  `@atrib/recall`, consumer-side: agents query their own provable past from the local signed-record mirror with per-record signature verification. Defaults to `~/.atrib/records/mcp-wrap-claude-code.jsonl`; override via `ATRIB_RECORD_FILE` env.

  `@atrib/trace`, consumer-side: walks `informed_by` chains backward from a record_hash to surface the reasoning chain that produced it.

  `@atrib/summarize`, consumer-side: synthesizes a narrative across N records via an OpenAI-compatible LLM so agents read context, not raw record bytes.

  Naming convention rationale: package names dropped the redundant `@atrib/atrib-` prefix in favor of `@atrib/<noun>` (per the `@atrib/<noun>` namespace pattern already used by `@atrib/mcp`, `@atrib/agent`, `@atrib/verify`, etc). Binary names retained the `atrib-<noun>` form to preserve operator hook-script compatibility, package rename only, no binary rename.

  Also adopted: the local mirror filename convention `<wrapper-name>-<agent>.jsonl` per spec §5.9 with the default wrapper name `mcp-wrap`. `@atrib/recall`'s default mirror path picks up this convention; existing wrappers using a different `name` config value should override `ATRIB_RECORD_FILE` accordingly.
